30	Locked house	Knock knock.	31									
31		Okay then.	End									
32	Fountain	Such peaceful, still water...	33									
33		It seems almost unreal how quiet it is.	34									
34		...It's not actually moving at all. That can't be healthy.	End									
35	Gathered ducks	These ducks seem strangely enthralled by something. Is it that duck on the water?	End									
36	Duck Jesus	Oh! Incredible! That duck is walking on water! Could it be...	37									
37		Duck Jesus?	38

39		Quack.	End									
40	fence	Nope. Can't go further. You're trapped here forever.	End

49		Long live Ratt.	End									
50	Turn back no pet	Old man told you to go to the pet store.	51		town 1							
51		Listen to your elders, dagnabbit.	End									
52	Shopkeep	You see these pets? THEY'RE MINE. All mine. Go get your own in the wild.	53									
53		Oh, but also: if you find your pets are low on energy after a battle, you can pay a visit to	54									
54		Duck Jesus and the power of faith healing will restore your party to full health.	55									
55		You may call it quackery, but just remember to visit the duck when your pets need help. 	End

57	Mary	There's quite the influx of ducks this time of year. Back in my home country, the ducks would	58									
58		stop eating for an entire month; it was quite bizarre. 	59									
59		Oh! Wait a second... Is that you? Oh I'm so glad to see you're back!	60									
60		I'm busy walking around aimlessly right now, so I can't talk much now. 	61									
61		However, I can remind you what pet-fighting is, in case you forgot. 	62									
62		Would you like to hear about it?	63 | 70	Yes | No								
63		You may have heard about pet-fighting; I know you just woke up from your coma, so allow me	64		Yes							
64		to explain it to you again.	65									
65		Basically, the local youths befriend animals and make them their pets, and then they have	66									
66		friendly play-fights. The animals definitely like it, they don't actually get hurt (despite what any	67									
67		battle text says).	68									
68		Even so, please be careful when playing with animals, we don't want to hurt them.	69									
69		Anyway, gotta go--it's so nice to have you back. 	End									
70		Oh, okay. It's so nice to have you back. 	End		No

72	Gentleman	Good weather today. Harumph. Good weather.	75									
73	Gentleman approach	Young lady, the petstore owner told me he has a visitor who wants to see you.	74									
74		I'd head there immediately, if I were you. 	75									
75		Would you like an explanation of the controls for this game?	77 | 76	Yes | No								
76		Oh, ok. (Typical young person, not listening to their elders, harumph...)	End		No							
77		Excellent! There are 2 primary keys you'll use: Z, which submits, and X, which cancels or 	78		Yes							
78		skips text. Alternatively, you can use J and K, or even Enter and Shift.	79									
79		Very hip and jive, am I right?	End

83					Route 1							
84	Nerd 1 approach	Hey watch out, all the people on this route are itching to walk up to you and talk about 	85									
85		who knows what. They're all freaks, if you ask me. 	86									
86		Who just stops someone and walks up to them, forcing conversation?	87									
87		I bet you're glad I warned you. See ya later! (Please)	End									
88	Nerd 2 approach	Hi! Hi! Hello! Good even-oops, I mean morning! 	89									
89		I'd like to tell you about the EXCITING world of befriending wild pets!	90									
90		Is "wild pet" an oxymoron? I don't know, I don't care, and frankly anyone who DOES care	91									
91		is not worth my time.	92									
92		Are you worth my time?	93 | 94 	Yes | Absolutely								
93		Of course. Okay so what you're gonna do--ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? -- is you're gonna 	95									
94		Of course. Okay so what you're gonna do--ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? -- is you're gonna 	95									
95		walk to that grass over there, and a wild pet is going to ATTAC-- try to say hi to you!	96									
96		When you defeat it, you can try to befriend it by saying mean or nice things to it.	97									
97		Isn't that neat? 	98									
98		I would hold your hand more through this, but I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea.	99									
99		Let's stay friends, for now. Ohoho.	End									
100	Warning lady	See that girl over there? She's gonna challenge you to a battle. If your pets are weary,	101									
101		remember to visit Duck Jesus in the town you came from.	102									
102		Just spreading the good word. Quack.	End									
103	Battle lady approach	Hi! I like skorts. They're comfy and easy to wear!	104									
104		Also, let's battle.	End			battleScreen1

110		(Why won't anyone let me into their houses?)	End									
111	door 2	Knock knock. 	112									
112		Ah, a visitor! I would absolutely let you into my house, stranger, but it's a mess in here.	113									
113		Come back another day when I'm feeling more inviting. And bring food.	End									
114	door 3	(I'm tired of harassing people.)	End									
115	unused space	Wow! Look at all this unused space! 	116									
116		It almost feels like more was planned here but was never built.	117									
117		As much as we hate them, taxes are important.	End									
118	shopkeep	Look, Duck Jesus has appeared in our town. I feel so blessed.	119									
119		...However, he's blocking the entrance to my shop. I wish I could get in.	End									
120	duck jesus	Oh, it's Duck Jesus again. Your party has been healed.	121									
121		Quack.	End									
122	gentleman	Seems that these 3 youngsters are itching to battle. I don't care about that, though.	123									
123		I like collecting shells. Shells are all that I need now.	124									
124		That and money. But saying that makes me feel a bit shellfish.	End									
125	Nerd	Hi, would you like to battle me? Can't battle Trish until you beat me and the other trainer.	126									
126		Are you ready?	127 | 128	Yes | No								
127		Let's go!	End			battleScreen1						
128		Okay, take your time neighbor. 	End									
129	Boy	Time to battle! I won't let you battle Trish, 'cause I'm her bodyguard!	End			battleScreen1						
130	Trish, not ready	Don'ta talk to me. I have ze no use for weaklings such as yourself.	131									
131		Battle my underlings first, zen we can talk about a real match.	End									
132	Trish, ready	Impressive, you've beaten both of zem. Now time for ze real challenge.	End			battleScreen_trish
