It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. s simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

56					town 1 NPCs							
57	Mary	There's quite the influx of ducks this time of year. Back in my home country, the ducks would stop eating for an entire month; it was quite bizarre. 	58									
58		Oh! Wait a second... Is that you? Oh I'm so glad to see you're back!	59									
59		I'm busy walking around aimlessly right now, so I can't talk much now. 	60									
60		However, I can remind you what pet-fighting is, in case you forgot. Would you like to hear about it?	61 | 65	Yes | No								
61		You may have heard about pet-fighting; I know you just woke up from your coma, so allow me to explain it to you again.	62		Yes							
62		Basically, the local youths befriend animals and make them their pets, and then they have friendly play-fights.	63									
63		The animals definitely like it, they don't actually get hurt (despite what any battle text says). Please be careful when playing with animals, we don't want to hurt them.	64									
64		Anyway, gotta go--it's so nice to have you back. 	End									
65		Oh, okay. It's so nice to have you back. 	End		No							
66	Gentleman	Good weather today. Harumph. Good weather.	70									
67	Gentleman approach	Young lady, the petstore owner told me he has something for you. I'd head there immediately, if I were you.	68									
68		Don't go out of this town. Otherwise I will be mildly perturbed.	69									
69		And you won't like it when I'm mildly perturbed. Harumph.	70									
70		Oh, by the way: would you like an explanation of the controls for this game?	72 | 71	Yes | No								
71		Oh, ok. (Typical young person, not listening to their elders, harumph...)	End		No							
72		Excellent! There are 2 primary keys you'll use: Z, which submits, and X, which cancels or skips text. Alternatively, you can use J and K, or even Enter and Shift.	73		Yes							
73		Pressing Escape will pull up some more useful hints. However, I've given you the best hints already. 	74									
74		If I catch you opening the hints panel with Escape, I will be mildly hurt. Mildly hurt, I say.	75									
75		So don't open the hints panel with Escape. Do I need to say it again?	76 | 77	Yes | No								
76		Don't open the hints panel with Escape.	78		Yes							
77		I'll say it anyway. Don't open the hints panel with Escape.	78		No							
78		... Okay I'm done.	End

95	Nerd 1 approach	Hey watch out, all the people on this route are itching to walk up to you and talk about who knows what.	96									
96		They're all freaks, if you ask me. Who just stops someone and walks up to them, forcing conversation?	97									
97		I bet you're glad I warned you. See ya later! (Please)	End									
98	Nerd 2 approach	Hi! Hi! Hello! Good even-oops, I mean morning! 	99									
99		I'd like to tell you about the EXCITING world of catching wild pets!	100									
100		Is "wild pet" an oxymoron? I don't know, I don't care, and frankly anyone who DOES care is not worth my time.	101									
101		Are you worth my time?	102 | 103	Yes | God yes								
102		Of course. Okay so what you're gonna do--ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? -- is you're gonna walk to that grass over there	104									
103		Of course. Okay so what you're gonna do--ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? -- is you're gonna walk to that grass over there	104									
104		and a wild pet is going to ATTAC-- try to say hi to you! At that point, you can try to recruit the pet and add it to your party.	105									
105		Or you can make it, um, faint from exhaustion (yes that's the phrase) and your pet will grow more powerful.	106									
106		Wow! Oh, but I don't want to hold your hand with this. Go try it out yourself.	End
