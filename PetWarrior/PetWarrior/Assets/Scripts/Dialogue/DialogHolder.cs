// This script is attached to any object that, when approached and you press SPACE,
// it'll trigger the attached text.

// Currently, it reads the dialogue lines from an array that I fill out in Unity.
// We want to switch this to read from a CSV file. For example,
// let's say we walk up to an NPC, and the conversation goes like this:

// 3 "Hi, how's it going?"
// 4 "Nice day, isn't it?"
// 5 "You've read 3 lines by now." ->End

// For this, you'd just input the line '3' in Unity.
// However, what if there are more complex things happening, like choices, or the
// start line depends on your serialized progress in the game?

// Will we need to write a separate script for that?
// A custom dialogue script?
// Perhaps in the spreadsheet, it could have a column that references a function to call.
// Also, we should make some universal functions, like a basic choice function.

// Ok, so here's our spreadsheet IDs:
// ID, Notes, Dialog Type, Links to, End Dialog, Thumbnail, Animation/Event?, 
// Text type, Text flow, Box type, Speaker, Text

// Hey, what about when the start line depends on the game progress serialization?
// Should we have a custom function for each "if" situation?
