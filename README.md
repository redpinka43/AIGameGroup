# AIGameGroup

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Hey guys, here we've got the game happening. 

Things you need to do to get set up:
* Install Unity https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
* Clone the repository to your computer (see this page) https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
  * Basically you just need to do "git clone https://github.com/*USERNAME/REPOSITORY*.git"
  * Another great Git tutorial is http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
* Open Unity, and open an existing project. Navigate to the AIGame folder which you've cloned to your computer in the previous step
* Press the big-ass triangle Play button at the top of the screen to run what we've got so far
* Lemme know how this all goes for you, we'll work through it if there's a problem (I'm an idiot sooooo maybe not best tutorial). I want everyone to be on the same page and up and running with Unity before we progress any further.

At this point, I just cloned my existing game so we have something to work with. I'm going to change all the art and stuff, so this is *not* just a copy of my other one. k cool
