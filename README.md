<h1>Week 15: </h1>

<h2> Iteration Implemented this Week </h2>
<h3> Blue UI for Player in Battle </h3>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/bluePlayerUI.PNG">
We changed the player health menu in battle to blue so that new players would better understand which healthbar goes to who.

<h3> Helper NPCs </h3>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/controlNPC.PNG">
This NPC explains the dialogue controls to the player.
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/wildEncounterNPC.PNG">
This NPC explains wild encounters to the player.

There are more helper NPCs that explain the story of pet battling and how to get your pets healed. All of these NPCs are meant to help the player learn the game easier than the play testers did a few weeks ago.

<h2> New Fully Implemented Features </h2>

<h3> Random Encounters Allow You to Be Naughty or Nice </h3>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/wildEncounter.PNG">
Some pets, as detailed in a post made in earlier weeks, respond to nice words while others prefer tough love. We have added the ability to choose how to treat your new pet after you defeat them in a wild encounter. If the pet likes you it can join your party.

<h3> Players can View their Party in the Overworld </h3>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/petPartyInGame.PNG">
This panel (which can be opened by pressing "p") will tell the player what pets they currently have in their party as well as their level and hp.

<h3> Players can Swap Pets in Battle </h3>
This helps the battle be more interesting because the player can strategize with which pet they would like to use during battle.

<h3> More Enemy Trainters </h3>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/moreEnemyTrainers.PNG">
We added more enemy trainers to give the player more to do. These trainers will provide a challenge and incentivize the player to go out and level up their pets.

<h1>Week 14: </h1>

<h2> AI Presentation </h2>
We had a presentation in class and wrote a paper on the AI aspects of PetWarrior as well as other significant technical aspects of the game.

[Here is the Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jxB51A9Oj6W3ggRXTP8gdp6JHUXPiaJ09A7ik0uzKq8/edit?usp=sharing)

[Here is the Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nscY5IZfQWvj8TnIyMArZdkngTG7ZmvBb5go9YuKR3M/edit?usp=sharing)

In the presentation and paper we discuss in detail the pets, battle system, user interface, NPCs, dialogue system, and our iteration and plans since testing day.

<h1>Week 13: </h1>

<h2>Added More NPCs to the Game</h2>

The NPC's will serve as guides (like a tutorial), trainers, or just another immersive aspect of the world. 

Example (youtube):

<h2>Added a "Typing" Effect to the Text (and Sound Effects)</h2>

This change really makes the game feel more polished.

Example (youtube):

[![Typing Effect](http://img.youtube.com/vi/F6MRBvw820s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6MRBvw820s)


<h2>Implemented Pet Breed Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

This will make the battles more interesting. Strategy will need to be used to defeat trainers who have pets with advantages over yours. It will also make the "Pets" option in battle more useful/necessary.

<h2>Leveling and XP Mechanics added to the Game</h2>

A necessary part of the game that will give the player's pet expereince after defeating an enemy. With enough experience, a pet will level up and its stats will increase. This allows the player to make their favorite pet stronger and defeat enemies that might have an advantage over them.

<h1>Week 12: </h1>
<h2> Basic Random Pet Encounters Added to Game</h2>

Example (youtube):

<h2>Added Items to Battle Screen and the Ability to Use Some Items</h2>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/BattleItems.PNG">


<h1>Week 10: </h1>
<h2>Added a Pet Party Menu</h2>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/petPartyMenu.PNG">

<h2>Added basic AI to the Game</h2>
The AI will randomly pick a move to use based on the pet's moveset. This will be the easiest AI foe in the game. The increasingly difficult AI will involve more strategic battle decisions which will take breed advantages into account along with buff and debuff moves.

<h1>Week 9: </h1>
<h2>Update the UI to Look more Professional</h2>
<h4>New Battle UI:</h4>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/moreProfessionalUI.PNG">
<h4>New Pause UI:</h4>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/moreProfessionalUI2.PNG">

<h1>Week 8: </h1>
<h2>Pet Stats</h2>
<h4>Information on the different stats between the pet breeds</h4>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/petStatInfo.PNG" height = "800">
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/statRanges.PNG">

<h2>Pet Moves</h2>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/petMoves.png" height = "800">
This chart shows most of the information relating to pet moves. What moves each pet will learn and when they will learn them; the effects of the move; whether the move is considered a buff/debuff, physical attack, or special attack.

<h2>Pause Menu</h2>

<img src = "/Images and Artwork/firstPauseMenu.PNG">
We created a basic pause menu for first playable that will later be given "Save Game" and "Quit and Save Game" functionality. The pause menu will also be given new artwork at a later date.

<h2>Overworld Maps</h2>
We added some maps for the overworld where the player can travel freely:
 
<h3>Player house</h3>
<h5><img src= "/Images and Artwork/playerHouseBasement.PNG" width = "375" height = "275"> 
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/playerHouseFirstFloor.PNG" width = "375" height = "275"></h5>
The player will start the game in the basement of their parents' house. They will have to go up the stairs to the first floor of the house to leave.
 
<h3>Town One</h3>
<img src = "/Images and Artwork/townOneWalkAround.gif">
This is the player's hometown.

<h1>Week 7: </h1>
<h2>Battle UI</h2>

<img src ="/Images and Artwork/fightUIFunctionality.gif">
The necessary UI mechanics for the battle screen and the fight screen are functional, but will be drastically changed visually with the addition of the pet sprites and different background images.

<h1>Week 6: </h1>
<h2>Scripts!</h2>

Chris: I wrote up the logic for a follower in the overworld. Right now it's just attatched to a placeholder until the sprite for the pets is finished. I also learned how triggers work in unity and set up one on an enemy sprite that activates if you walk in it's line of sight. He'll rush at you and the battle will appear.


<h1>Week 5: </h1>
<h2>First UI</h2>

<img src ="/Images and Artwork/firstStartMenu.PNG">
This draft of the start menu uses placeholder images until we create our own artwork.

<h1>Week 4: </h1>
<h2>Pet Warrior Types Strength/Weaknesses Chart</h2>

<img src ="/Images and Artwork/PetWarriorTypesChart.png">

<h3>Pet Concepts</h3>

<h3>Trainer Concepts</h3>

<h1>Week 3: </h1>
We nail down all of the game mechanics we're going to work on and distribute the work load. Lucia will be working on the art and audio, Chris will be working on programming the AI of the NPCs and Battle System, Megan will work on putting the user interfaces and dialogue aspects in the game. We also finally decide to call the game Pet Warrior

<h4>Pet Stats</h4>
<p>A list of stats that will affect the outcome of a battle</p>
<img src ="/Images and Artwork/Stats.png" height="512">



<h1>Week 2: </h1>
We met up and discussed what type of adventure the player might go on in our game. We want it to have a sense of humor. Megan was put in charge of writing up a script and we all would pitch our opinions and ideas as she created it.<br>
*script here*<br>

We have a basic level design and we begin to think about how many levels and rooms our player will be able to move around in.
<h4>Sample level</h4>
<img src ="/Images and Artwork/Sample_level.png" height="480">



<h1>Week 1: </h1>
We all met up to discuss what type of game we wanted to create. We decided on a "Pokemon" type RPG. We want the player to collect pets and fight them in turn based combat. Each with their own unique abilities, the player must accomplish some task set before them and travel through several stages with their pets, using them in battles along the way. The name was not decided yet, and a lot of the details still needed to be discussed. We knew it was going to be a 2D pixel art game created in the Unity game engine and we created some basic assets as a prototype for what it might look like.

<h4>NPC Prototype sprite</h4>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Hey guys, here we've got the game happening. 

Things you need to do to get set up:
* Install Unity https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
* Clone the repository to your computer (see this page) https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
  * Basically you just need to do "git clone https://github.com/*USERNAME/REPOSITORY*.git"
  * Another great Git tutorial is http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
* Open Unity, and open an existing project. Navigate to the AIGame folder which you've cloned to your computer in the previous step
* Press the big triangle Play button at the top of the screen to run what we've got so far.
