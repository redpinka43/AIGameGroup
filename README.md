This chart shows most of the information relating to pet moves. What moves each pet will learn and when they will learn them; the effects of the move; whether the move is considered a buff/debuff, physical attack, or special attack.

<h2>Pause Menu</h2>

<img src = "/Images and Artwork/firstPauseMenu.PNG">
We created a basic pause menu for first playable that will later be given "Save Game" and "Quit and Save Game" functionality. The pause menu will also be given new artwork at a later date.

<h2>Overworld Maps</h2>
We added some maps for the overworld where the player can travel freely:
 
<h3>Player house</h3>

<img src = "/Images and Artwork/playerHouseFirstFloor.PNG" width = "375" height = "275"></h5>
The player will start the game in the basement of their parents' house. They will have to go up the stairs to the first floor of the house to leave.
 
<h3>Town One</h3>

This is the player's hometown.

<h1>Week 7: </h1>
<h2>Battle UI</h2>

<img src ="/Images and Artwork/fightUIFunctionality.gif">
The necessary UI mechanics for the battle screen and the fight screen are functional, but will be drastically changed visually with the addition of the pet sprites and different background images.

<h1>Week 6: </h1>
<h2>Scripts!</h2>

Chris: I wrote up the logic for a follower in the overworld. Right now it's just attatched to a placeholder until the sprite for the pets is finished. I also learned how triggers work in unity and set up one on an enemy sprite that activates if you walk in it's line of sight. He'll rush at you and the battle will appear.


<h1>Week 5: </h1>
<h2>First UI</h2>

<img src ="/Images and Artwork/firstStartMenu.PNG">
This draft of the start menu uses placeholder images until we create our own artwork.

<h1>Week 4: </h1>
<h2>Pet Warrior Types Strength/Weaknesses Chart</h2>

<h1>Week 3: </h1>
We nail down all of the game mechanics we're going to work on and distribute the work load. Lucia will be working on the art and audio, Chris will be working on programming the AI of the NPCs and Battle System, Megan will work on putting the user interfaces and dialogue aspects in the game. We also finally decide to call the game Pet Warrior

<h4>Pet Stats</h4>

<h1>Week 2: </h1>
We met up and discussed what type of adventure the player might go on in our game. We want it to have a sense of humor. Megan was put in charge of writing up a script and we all would pitch our opinions and ideas as she created it.<br>
*script here*<br>

We have a basic level design and we begin to think about how many levels and rooms our player will be able to move around in.
<h4>Sample level</h4>

<h1>Week 1: </h1>
We all met up to discuss what type of game we wanted to create. We decided on a "Pokemon" type RPG. We want the player to collect pets and fight them in turn based combat. Each with their own unique abilities, the player must accomplish some task set before them and travel through several stages with their pets, using them in battles along the way. The name was not decided yet, and a lot of the details still needed to be discussed. We knew it was going to be a 2D pixel art game created in the Unity game engine and we created some basic assets as a prototype for what it might look like.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Hey guys, here we've got the game happening. 

Things you need to do to get set up:
* Install Unity https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
* Clone the repository to your computer (see this page) https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
  * Basically you just need to do "git clone https://github.com/*USERNAME/REPOSITORY*.git"
  * Another great Git tutorial is http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
* Open Unity, and open an existing project. Navigate to the AIGame folder which you've cloned to your computer in the previous step
* Press the big triangle Play button at the top of the screen to run what we've got so far.
