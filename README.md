# AIGameGroup

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Hey guys, here we've got the game happening. 

Things you need to do to get set up:
* Install Unity https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
* Clone the repository to your computer (see this page) https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
  * Basically you just need to do "git clone https://github.com/*USERNAME/REPOSITORY*.git"
  * Another great Git tutorial is http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
* Open Unity, and open an existing project. Navigate to the AIGame folder which you've cloned to your computer in the previous step
* Press the big-ass triangle Play button at the top of the screen to run what we've got so far
* Lemme know how this all goes for you, we'll work through it if there's a problem (I'm an idiot sooooo maybe not best tutorial). I want everyone to be on the same page and up and running with Unity before we progress any further.

At this point, I just cloned my existing game so we have something to work with. I'm going to change all the art and stuff, so this is *not* just a copy of my other one. k cool

<h1>Week 1: </h1>
We all met up to discuss what type of game we wanted to create. We decided on a "Pokemon" type RPG. We set in stone that we will collect pets and fight them in turn based combat. Each with their own unique abilities, the player must accomplish some task set before them and travel through several stages with their pets, using them in battles along the way. The name was not decided yet, and a lot of the details still needed to be discussed. We knew it was going to be a 2D pixel art game and we created a basic world as a prototype for what it might look like.
